- run game on server
- server tells clients when it starts, they both start timer and track elapsed
- server buffer frames @fps (with max buffer size eg. 1 sec)
- each frame contains position info and game state
- clients send input immediately
- clients measure elapsed time and render frame by requesting frame from server for given elapsed time
